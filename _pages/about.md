I am currently a fourth year undergraduate at The University of Chicago majoring in mathematics and economics with a specialization in data science. I have formerly worked at [The Federal Reserve Board of Governors](https://www.federalreserve.gov/), [Pluribus Labs LLC](https://pluribuslabs.com), and [MobLab Inc](https://www.moblab.com/).

Research
My research interests are in applied microeconomics and econometrics. My current work pertains to online markets and discrimination.
